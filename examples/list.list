# "^*" is the main runtime
# "^*.windows" runs a category if it is on windows
# "^*.other" runs a category if it is on another unknown os

$W = ^*.windows
$O = ^*.other

# the main list for the windows variable:
{W}1 - ("sleep 1") # runs the command `sleep 1`
{W}2 - ("ping youtube.com") # runs the command `cargo run`

# the secondary list for the other variable:
{O}1 - ("sleep 2") # runs the command `sleep 1`
{O}2 - ("ping google.com") # runs the command `cargo run`

# essentially this list wil sleep for a certain
# amount of time (depending on the os) and then
# ping either google.com or youtube.com (depending
# on your os)
